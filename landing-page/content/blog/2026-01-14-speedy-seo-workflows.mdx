# Speedy SEO Workflows for Small Teams

Small teams can still move fast by focusing on high-ROI tasks and automating checks.

## Workflow

1. Keyword & PAA discovery (weekly, brief)
2. Draft short answer blocks for top PAA questions
3. Add schema for eligible pages
4. Run a lightweight CI check for broken links and mobile viewport
5. Monitor using Search Console and iterate

Automate what you can (linting, link checks, sitemap generation) and keep publish cycles short — often a few targeted updates beat large rewrites.

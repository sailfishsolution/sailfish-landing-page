# Structured Data for Snippets

Structured data doesn't guarantee snippets, but it gives search engines clearer signals about the type and purpose of your content.

## Patterns

- `FAQPage` for common questions
- `HowTo` for step-by-step guides
- `Article` + `author` + `datePublished` for trusted context

### Small code example (FAQ)

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What is structured data?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Structured data is machine-readable metadata that helps search engines interpret a page's content."
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Implement schema where it makes sense, and test it using Google's Rich Results Test or the Schema Markup Validator.

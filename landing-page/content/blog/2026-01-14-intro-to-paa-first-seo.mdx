# Intro to PAA-First SEO

People-Also-Ask (PAA) panels surface targeted questions users actually search for. Building content with a PAA-first mindset helps you capture both organic clicks and featured snippets.

## Quick checklist

- Identify high-value PAA questions for your topic
- Answer each question concisely (40–60 words)
- Provide a short, supporting paragraph with examples or steps
- Use structured data where appropriate

### Example

Q: "How does structured data improve SEO?"

A: Structured data helps search engines understand the relationships in your content and increases the chance of eligible rich results like FAQs or Q&A. Adding schema.org markup for `FAQPage` or `QAPage` makes PAA and snippet extraction more likely.

> Tip: Keep answers direct — search engines prefer short, explicit Q&A blocks for PAA extraction.

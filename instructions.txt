Role: Senior Full Stack Developer & SEO Specialist.
Task: Build a high-performance, SEO-optimized landing page for "Sailfish Solution" using Next.js 14+ (App Router) and Tailwind CSS that will be on GitHub and hosted on Vercel.
Context: This is the marketing site for a suite of AI SEO tools. No tools are live yet, but the site must be architected to easily link to future tools in the same repo (e.g., PAA Factory, Schema Gen etc). Focus on phase 1: landing page only, with placeholders for future phases (e.g., phase 2: add first tool; phase 3: add Supabase auth and Lemon Squeezy checkout—ignore these for now).
Tech Stack:
Framework: Next.js (App Router) hosted on Vercel.
Styling: Tailwind CSS with Dark/Light mode support (using next-themes).
Repo Structure: Monorepo style using Turborepo at root. Align to existing local setup (root folder "SailfishSolution" with .git and .gitattributes; build on dev branch). Folders:

/landing-page: The Next.js app for the marketing site.
/paa-factory-tool: Empty placeholder folder for future PAA Factory tool (add only README.md noting "Init SvelteKit here in phase 2 with npx create-svelte@latest. Hostable on Vercel.").

Root files: package.json, turbo.json, tsconfig.json (if needed) for shared monorepo config. In future phases, add more tool folders similarly (e.g., /schema-gen-tool).
Design Requirements:
Minimalist, clean, "developer-focused" aesthetic (similar to Vercel/Linear).
Responsive layout (Mobile/Desktop).
Navigation Bar: Based on provided sketch—top bar with Logo "Sailfish Solution", links: Tools (Dropdown/Link with tabs for placeholders), Blog, About, Pricing, Socials. Include a left sidebar "TAB" section interpreted as a tabbed interface for tool previews or content sections (use reusable Tabs component with Headless UI or Radix UI and Tailwind).
Hero Section: High impact H1, Subtext, Primary CTA, Secondary CTA.
Footer: Standard SaaS footer with links to pages, socials, and copyright.
Implement a working tabs component in the Tools section/page. For phase 1, show tabs for placeholder tools like "PAA Factory" and "Schema Gen" with "Coming Soon" content in each tab. Make reusable and extensible—configure via a JSON array in a config file, so adding real tools later is just updating the array and linking to sub-folders/apps.
Specific Content Placeholders (Developer-Focused):

Hero: H1 "Unlock AI-Powered SEO Mastery with Sailfish Solution", Subtext "Fast, smart tools for developers—coming soon.", Primary CTA "Join Waitlist", Secondary CTA "Explore Tools".
About: Establish trust with sections on mission, team (fictional bios), and expertise in AI/SEO.
Pricing: Tabs for "Free", "Pro", "Enterprise" plans with feature lists and comparisons.
Blog: List view with 2 sample posts like "The Future of AI in SEO" and "How Schema Markup Boosts Rankings".
Socials: Placeholder links to Twitter, GitHub, etc.
Tools Section: Tabs for "PAA Factory" (placeholder: "Coming Soon—AI for People Also Ask"), "Schema Gen" (similar), linked to future /paa-factory-tool routes.

Pages to Build in /landing-page: Home (landing with Hero), About (with author bios for E-E-A-T), Blog (list + single post views), Pricing (with tabs).
Blog Structure: Use MDX (ContentLayer or similar) in /landing-page/content/blog folder to make adding articles easy (just drop .mdx files). Include 2 sample .mdx files for testing.
SEO & E-E-A-T Requirements (Critical):
Include Semantic HTML (, , ).
Implement JSON-LD Schema (Organization and WebSite).
Add an "About" page to establish Trust/Authority, including author bios in About and blog posts.
Image optimization (Next.js Image component), lazy loading, meta tags (using next/head or app router metadata).
Add Open Graph meta, sitemap.xml, robots.txt.
Require Lighthouse scores >90 for performance/SEO in phase 1 testing.
Phase 1 Extensibility & Future-Proofing:

Use API routes or Edge functions as placeholders for tool integrations.
Make nav's Tools dropdown dynamic (pulled from /landing-page/config/tools.js array) so adding new tools is just updating the array.
Ensure dark/light mode is toggleable and persists via localStorage.
Routes like /tools/[slug] for dynamic tool pages linking to future tool folders.
For future tools (e.g., PAA Factory in phase 2): Prep for SvelteKit in /paa-factory-tool; easy to add more folders later.
Ignore Supabase auth and Lemon Squeezy for now—add in phase 3.

Testing & Deployment:

Local dev setup commands (e.g., npm install at root, then in /landing-page).
GitHub repo init with README.md (including Vercel deployment steps: "cd landing-page && vercel").
Unit tests for components (via Jest), accessibility checks (ARIA attributes).

Output Format (Since Repo Exists Locally):

Do not create a new repo or init Git.
Output a clear file structure tree from root, then key setup commands, then each file's full path (e.g., /landing-page/app/page.tsx) with complete code/content for easy copy-paste into VS Code.
